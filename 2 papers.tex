\textbf{Synthesis:} Both studies establish critical theoretical foundations for FaaS-edge integration, revealing the fundamental gap between cloud-centric serverless models and edge computing requirements. Their convergent findings validate the necessity for specialized simulation frameworks capable of modeling complex interactions between resource constraints, network dynamics, security requirements, and application performance in distributed edge-cloud environments.

The comprehensive analysis reveals distinct research contributions across simulation frameworks, conceptual studies, and practical implementations. Simulation-focused papers (ServerlessSimPro, faas-sim, EdgeFaaS) provide concrete tools with varying edge computing capabilities, while conceptual papers (Aslanpour et al.) identify critical challenges and opportunities. Application studies (Belcastro et al.) demonstrate real-world feasibility, and survey papers (Mampage et al.) provide comprehensive taxonomies for future research directions.

The matrix clearly establishes faas-sim as the most comprehensive simulation framework for edge-IoT applications, combining trace-driven accuracy with extensive edge device support. ServerlessSimPro excels in energy modeling for cloud environments, while conceptual papers provide essential theoretical foundations for understanding the broader FaaS-edge research landscape.
