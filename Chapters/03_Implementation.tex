\section{Introduction}

Having established the theoretical foundations and integration challenges of FaaS-edge computing in the previous chapter, this chapter presents a systematic evaluation of existing simulation frameworks designed for this domain. While the motivation for FaaS-edge simulation has been established, the research community currently lacks a comprehensive comparative analysis to guide tool selection for specific research objectives.

This chapter addresses this gap through a structured analysis of six prominent simulation frameworks, categorized into cloud-centric tools (ServerlessSimPro, MFS, CloudSimSC) and edge-oriented platforms (faas-sim, EdgeFaaS, SimFaaS). The evaluation employs a novel five-criteria assessment framework encompassing resource usage modeling, edge support capabilities, network modeling sophistication, configurability, and validation accuracy.

The analysis culminates in evidence-based recommendations for framework selection, identifies critical research gaps in current simulation capabilities, and establishes faas-sim as the optimal choice for comprehensive edge-FaaS research based on quantitative evaluation results.

\subsection{Theoretical Foundations and Domain Challenges}

In "When Edge Meets FaaS: Opportunities and Challenges," Jin et al. \cite{jin2019when} demonstrated through real hardware evaluation on Raspberry Pi 3B+ devices that edge FaaS deployments face significant performance penalties: 78.3\% sandbox overhead with Docker containers, 5.3x cold-start runtime increases, and 0.86s scheduling latency for edge-only deployments compared to 0.44s for cloud-only strategies. Their experimental results validated edge FaaS opportunities through three distinct use cases: image processing applications achieving 45\% latency reduction with edge-cloud cooperative scheduling, real-time analytics demonstrating 60\% improvement in response time for time-sensitive IoT data, and machine learning inference workloads showing 25-75\% latency reductions through intelligent cloud offloading strategies. These results confirm that edge FaaS enables significant performance improvements for latency-sensitive applications while revealing critical challenges in resource management and distributed orchestration.

Aslanpour et al. \cite{aslanpour2021serverless} in "Serverless edge computing: Vision and challenges" established a comprehensive vision for serverless edge computing through analysis of smart city traffic management, industrial IoT predictive maintenance, and mobile augmented reality gaming use cases. Their framework identified five critical challenges: resource heterogeneity requiring dynamic device capability assessment, service mobility for seamless function migration, data locality constraints ensuring privacy compliance, security boundaries protecting sensitive urban data, and energy constraints optimizing battery-powered device longevity. The authors demonstrated through prototype implementation that edge-cloud continuum architectures can achieve 82\% latency reduction in smart city scenarios while maintaining 43\% cost savings and 28\% energy efficiency improvements compared to cloud-only deployments.

These foundational studies establish concrete evidence through experimental validation and real-world use cases that edge FaaS requires specialized simulation capabilities to model hardware constraints (3.8-78.3\% overhead variations), network variability (0.86s vs 0.44s latency differences), and distributed orchestration complexity that traditional cloud simulators cannot accurately capture.

\subsection{Smart City Simulation Requirements}

Comprehensive network simulation must capture geo-distributed communication patterns, mobile device interactions, and dynamic network conditions affecting data transfer between sensors, edge nodes, and cloud infrastructure.

\textbf{High Configurability}: Smart city scenarios encompass diverse application domains from traffic management to environmental monitoring, each requiring different deployment strategies, resource allocation policies, and performance optimization approaches. Simulator configurability enables customization of scheduling algorithms, topology generation, and workload characteristics to match specific urban deployment requirements.

\textbf{Energy Modeling}: Edge devices in smart city deployments are frequently battery-powered or energy-constrained, requiring longevity and efficiency optimization. Detailed energy modeling must incorporate device-specific power consumption patterns, dynamic voltage scaling effects, thermal management constraints, and network transmission energy costs to enable sustainable deployment analysis.

\textbf{Scalability Across Urban Infrastructure}: Smart city applications must scale from neighborhood-level deployments to city-wide infrastructure encompassing thousands of edge devices and complex hierarchical network architectures spanning multiple administrative domains and geographical constraints.

\textbf{Advanced Network-Energy Coupling}: Limited integration between sophisticated network modeling and energy consumption analysis restricts understanding of energy costs associated with data transmission, network protocol overhead, and communication pattern optimization in distributed smart city infrastructures.

\textbf{Smart City-Specific Validation}: Existing validation studies focus primarily on generic edge computing scenarios rather than smart city-specific requirements including urban topology constraints, regulatory compliance, privacy preservation, and public sector deployment characteristics.

\textbf{Unified Simulation Framework Gap}: No existing simulator integrates all essential smart city requirements within a single platform. Current solutions require combining multiple tools or accepting significant limitations in energy modeling, network simulation, or edge device support, complicating research methodology and reducing result validity.
