\section{Introduction}

Having established the theoretical foundations and integration challenges of FaaS-edge computing in the previous chapter, this chapter presents a systematic evaluation of existing simulation frameworks designed for this domain. While the motivation for FaaS-edge simulation has been established, the research community currently lacks a comprehensive comparative analysis to guide tool selection for specific research objectives.

This chapter addresses this gap through a structured analysis of six prominent simulation frameworks, categorized into cloud-centric tools (ServerlessSimPro, MFS, CloudSimSC) and edge-oriented platforms (faas-sim, EdgeFaaS, SimFaaS). The evaluation employs a novel five-criteria assessment framework encompassing resource usage modeling, edge support capabilities, network modeling sophistication, configurability, and validation accuracy.

The analysis culminates in evidence-based recommendations for framework selection, identifies critical research gaps in current simulation capabilities, and establishes faas-sim as the optimal choice for comprehensive edge-FaaS research based on quantitative evaluation results.

\section{FaaS Simulation Frameworks}


\subsection{Cloud-Centric FaaS Simulators}

Cloud-centric simulators primarily target traditional cloud environments with abundant computational resources, focusing on scalability, cost optimization, and performance analysis in centralized data center deployments.


\subsubsection{ServerlessSimPro}

ServerlessSimPro represents a comprehensive cloud-centric simulation platform designed for realistic serverless environment modeling \cite{das2022serverlesssimpro}. Built with a three-tier architecture encompassing Physical Machines (PMs), containers, and functions, the simulator utilizes real-world traces from the AzureFunctionsInvocationTrace2021 dataset to ensure high-fidelity modeling.

The simulator's key strengths lie in its extensive scheduling algorithm support, including FirstFit, Linear Programming, and energy optimization strategies. ServerlessSimPro introduces pioneering energy consumption trackingâ€”the first simulator to incorporate this critical metric for serverless computing. The platform supports sophisticated container lifecycle management with detailed modeling of cold starts, warm containers, and container migration capabilities.

Experimental results demonstrate the simulator's effectiveness in optimizing resource allocation strategies. The Linear Programming deployment approach achieves approximately 5\% cost reduction compared to FirstFit algorithms while improving scalability. Energy optimization using dynamic programming-based heuristics significantly reduces both execution time and power consumption. Container migration strategies, including Balance-Aware Placement (BACP) and Adaptive Threshold Migration (ATCM), ensure efficient load distribution and resource consolidation.

However, ServerlessSimPro's primary limitation lies in its cloud-centric design philosophy, lacking explicit support for edge computing environments. The simulator does not model edge-specific constraints such as device heterogeneity, intermittent connectivity, or resource limitations typical of IoT deployments.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{assets/lambdacontsim.png}
\caption{EdgeFaaS architecture featuring distributed edge orchestration with dynamic infrastructure management and energy consumption tracking \cite{li2022edgefaas}.}
\label{fig:edgefaas-architecture}
\end{figure}


EdgeFaaS incorporates sophisticated placement strategy evaluation through comprehensive case study analysis. Experimental validation with 700 experiments across varying infrastructure sizes demonstrates placement service time fluctuations ranging from 60-180ms independent of infrastructure scale.

The simulator supports customizable infrastructure definition through YAML/Prolog configuration files, enabling flexible deployment scenario modeling. However, EdgeFaaS exhibits limitations in network modeling, lacking data flow and bandwidth simulation capabilities essential for comprehensive edge-cloud interaction analysis.



\subsubsection{SimFaaS}

SimFaaS provides a modular simulator designed for cloud-edge FaaS environments with emphasis on QoS-aware scheduling and high configurability \cite{mahmoudi2021simfaas}. The platform supports hybrid deployment models spanning cloud and edge infrastructures with region-based latency configuration for realistic edge-cloud behavior modeling.

The two-tier system architecture maps function requests to execution instances, which may represent containers, virtual machines, or edge nodes depending on deployment requirements. SimFaaS abstracts containers as execution instances without detailed container lifecycle modeling, focusing instead on instance utilization metrics including CPU and memory consumption patterns.

The simulator's strength lies in its modular and pluggable architecture, enabling rapid experimentation with custom scheduling algorithms, function types, and instance provisioning rules. QoS constraint modeling allows simulation of request deadlines, resource requirements, and origin types with comprehensive success/failure tracking based on constraint violations.

SimFaaS supports flexible environment configuration through multiple region definitions with configurable latency, capacity, and pricing parameters. The platform demonstrates effectiveness in comparing centralized versus decentralized scheduling approaches, showing improved success ratios for decentralized strategies under high latency and strict deadline scenarios.

However, SimFaaS lacks energy consumption metrics and detailed container lifecycle modeling, limiting its depth for edge IoT simulation requirements. Network modeling capabilities remain basic, relying primarily on region-based latency configurations without explicit data flow simulation. The abstraction of containers as generic instances reduces modeling fidelity compared to simulators with detailed container lifecycle support.


\section{Comparative Analysis Framework}

\subsection{Simulator Assessment Methodology}

The assessment methodology applies systematic evaluation across the defined criteria, utilizing both quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis derived from literature review and experimental evidence. Each simulator receives evaluation across multiple dimensions with particular emphasis on edge computing requirements and IoT application suitability.

\section{Simulator Evaluation Results}

\subsection{Simulator Analysis}

The evaluation reveals distinct strengths and limitations across both cloud-centric and edge-oriented FaaS simulators. Cloud-centric simulators demonstrate strong capabilities in resource management, scheduling optimization, and scalability analysis within traditional data center environments. ServerlessSimPro leads in energy consumption tracking and scheduling algorithm diversity, achieving notable cost reductions through Linear Programming approaches. MFS provides superior container lifecycle modeling with comprehensive metric reporting, while CloudSimSC offers flexible architecture supporting multiple execution paradigms.

However, cloud-centric simulators exhibit consistent limitations in edge computing support. None provide comprehensive modeling of edge-specific constraints including device heterogeneity, resource limitations, or intermittent connectivity patterns. Network modeling capabilities remain inadequate for edge-cloud scenarios, lacking support for dynamic topologies and distributed communication patterns essential for IoT applications.

In contrast, edge-oriented simulators demonstrate superior capabilities for IoT and smart city applications through comprehensive edge environment modeling. faas-sim emerges as the most comprehensive solution, providing trace-driven modeling with less than 7\% error rates, extensive heterogeneous device support, and sophisticated network simulation through Ether integration. The simulator's modular architecture and co-simulation capabilities enable dynamic optimization and real-world validation.

\subsection{Theoretical Foundations and Domain Challenges}

In "When Edge Meets FaaS: Opportunities and Challenges," Jin et al. \cite{jin2019when} demonstrated through real hardware evaluation on Raspberry Pi 3B+ devices that edge FaaS deployments face significant performance penalties: 78.3\% sandbox overhead with Docker containers, 5.3x cold-start runtime increases, and 0.86s scheduling latency for edge-only deployments compared to 0.44s for cloud-only strategies. Their experimental results validated edge FaaS opportunities through three distinct use cases: image processing applications achieving 45\% latency reduction with edge-cloud cooperative scheduling, real-time analytics demonstrating 60\% improvement in response time for time-sensitive IoT data, and machine learning inference workloads showing 25-75\% latency reductions through intelligent cloud offloading strategies. These results confirm that edge FaaS enables significant performance improvements for latency-sensitive applications while revealing critical challenges in resource management and distributed orchestration.

Aslanpour et al. \cite{aslanpour2021serverless} in "Serverless edge computing: Vision and challenges" established a comprehensive vision for serverless edge computing through analysis of smart city traffic management, industrial IoT predictive maintenance, and mobile augmented reality gaming use cases. Their framework identified five critical challenges: resource heterogeneity requiring dynamic device capability assessment, service mobility for seamless function migration, data locality constraints ensuring privacy compliance, security boundaries protecting sensitive urban data, and energy constraints optimizing battery-powered device longevity. The authors demonstrated through prototype implementation that edge-cloud continuum architectures can achieve 82\% latency reduction in smart city scenarios while maintaining 43\% cost savings and 28\% energy efficiency improvements compared to cloud-only deployments.

These foundational studies establish concrete evidence through experimental validation and real-world use cases that edge FaaS requires specialized simulation capabilities to model hardware constraints (3.8-78.3\% overhead variations), network variability (0.86s vs 0.44s latency differences), and distributed orchestration complexity that traditional cloud simulators cannot accurately capture.

\subsection{Smart City Simulation Requirements}

Smart city FaaS applications demand specific simulation capabilities that extend beyond traditional cloud-centric models:

\textbf{Accurate Edge Simulation with Trace-Driven Models}: Smart city deployments require realistic modeling of heterogeneous edge devices with varying computational capabilities, memory constraints, and processing characteristics. Trace-driven simulation ensures high-fidelity representation of real-world device behavior and workload execution patterns essential for accurate performance prediction.

\textbf{Robust Network Modeling}: Urban IoT environments involve complex network topologies with varying connectivity patterns, bandwidth limitations, and latency characteristics. Comprehensive network simulation must capture geo-distributed communication patterns, mobile device interactions, and dynamic network conditions affecting data transfer between sensors, edge nodes, and cloud infrastructure.

\textbf{High Configurability}: Smart city scenarios encompass diverse application domains from traffic management to environmental monitoring, each requiring different deployment strategies, resource allocation policies, and performance optimization approaches. Simulator configurability enables customization of scheduling algorithms, topology generation, and workload characteristics to match specific urban deployment requirements.

\textbf{Energy Modeling}: Edge devices in smart city deployments are frequently battery-powered or energy-constrained, requiring longevity and efficiency optimization. Detailed energy modeling must incorporate device-specific power consumption patterns, dynamic voltage scaling effects, thermal management constraints, and network transmission energy costs to enable sustainable deployment analysis.

\textbf{Scalability Across Urban Infrastructure}: Smart city applications must scale from neighborhood-level deployments to city-wide infrastructure encompassing thousands of edge devices and complex hierarchical network architectures spanning multiple administrative domains and geographical constraints.

\subsection{Identified Research Gaps}

Analysis of existing simulators against smart city requirements reveals critical gaps that limit comprehensive FaaS-edge research:


\textbf{Trace-Driven Energy Integration}: While faas-sim provides trace-driven execution modeling and ServerlessSimPro offers energy tracking, no simulator combines comprehensive trace-driven accuracy with detailed energy consumption modeling essential for battery-powered edge device analysis in smart city deployments.

\textbf{Advanced Network-Energy Coupling}: Limited integration between sophisticated network modeling and energy consumption analysis restricts understanding of energy costs associated with data transmission, network protocol overhead, and communication pattern optimization in distributed smart city infrastructures.

\textbf{Smart City-Specific Validation}: Existing validation studies focus primarily on generic edge computing scenarios rather than smart city-specific requirements including urban topology constraints, regulatory compliance, privacy preservation, and public sector deployment characteristics.

\textbf{Unified Simulation Framework Gap}: No existing simulator integrates all essential smart city requirements within a single platform. Current solutions require combining multiple tools or accepting significant limitations in energy modeling, network simulation, or edge device support, complicating research methodology and reducing result validity.
