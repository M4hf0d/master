\section{Introduction}

Having established the theoretical foundations and integration challenges of FaaS-edge computing in the previous chapter, this chapter presents a systematic evaluation of existing simulation frameworks designed for this domain. While the motivation for FaaS-edge simulation has been established, the research community currently lacks a comprehensive comparative analysis to guide tool selection for specific research objectives.

This chapter addresses this gap through a structured analysis of six prominent simulation frameworks, categorized into cloud-centric tools (ServerlessSimPro, MFS, CloudSimSC) and edge-oriented platforms (faas-sim, EdgeFaaS, SimFaaS). The evaluation employs a novel five-criteria assessment framework encompassing resource usage modeling, edge support capabilities, network modeling sophistication, configurability, and validation accuracy.

The analysis culminates in evidence-based recommendations for framework selection, identifies critical research gaps in current simulation capabilities, and establishes faas-sim as the optimal choice for comprehensive edge-FaaS research based on quantitative evaluation results.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Cloud-Centric FaaS Simulators}

Cloud-centric simulators primarily target traditional cloud environments with abundant computational resources, focusing on scalability, cost optimization, and performance analysis in centralized data center deployments.

\subsubsection{ServerlessSimPro}

ServerlessSimPro represents a comprehensive cloud-centric simulation platform designed for realistic serverless environment modeling \cite{das2022serverlesssimpro}. Built with a three-tier architecture encompassing Physical Machines (PMs), containers, and functions, the simulator utilizes real-world traces from the AzureFunctionsInvocationTrace2021 dataset to ensure high-fidelity modeling.

The simulator's key strengths lie in its extensive scheduling algorithm support, including FirstFit, Linear Programming, and energy optimization strategies. ServerlessSimPro introduces pioneering energy consumption trackingâ€”the first simulator to incorporate this critical metric for serverless computing. The platform supports sophisticated container lifecycle management with detailed modeling of cold starts, warm containers, and container migration capabilities.

Experimental results demonstrate the simulator's effectiveness in optimizing resource allocation strategies. The Linear Programming deployment approach achieves approximately 5\% cost reduction compared to FirstFit algorithms while improving scalability. Energy optimization using dynamic programming-based heuristics significantly reduces both execution time and power consumption. Container migration strategies, including Balance-Aware Placement (BACP) and Adaptive Threshold Migration (ATCM), ensure efficient load distribution and resource consolidation.

However, ServerlessSimPro's primary limitation lies in its cloud-centric design philosophy, lacking explicit support for edge computing environments. The simulator does not model edge-specific constraints such as device heterogeneity, intermittent connectivity, or resource limitations typical of IoT deployments.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{EdgeFaaS}

EdgeFaaS provides a Python-based simulation platform specifically designed for edge FaaS orchestration across distributed, heterogeneous infrastructures \cite{li2022edgefaas}. The simulator addresses the unique challenges of function deployment in cloud-edge continuum environments, supporting dynamic infrastructure changes and energy consumption tracking.

The platform supports hybrid deployment models spanning cloud and edge infrastructures with region-based latency configuration for realistic edge-cloud behavior modeling.

The two-tier system architecture maps function requests to execution instances, which may represent containers, virtual machines, or edge nodes depending on deployment requirements. SimFaaS abstracts containers as execution instances without detailed container lifecycle modeling, focusing instead on instance utilization metrics including CPU and memory consumption patterns.

The simulator's strength lies in its modular and pluggable architecture, enabling rapid experimentation with custom scheduling algorithms, function types, and instance provisioning rules. QoS constraint modeling allows simulation of request deadlines, resource requirements, and origin types with comprehensive success/failure tracking based on constraint violations.

SimFaaS supports flexible environment configuration through multiple region definitions with configurable latency, capacity, and pricing parameters. The platform demonstrates effectiveness in comparing centralized versus decentralized scheduling approaches, showing improved success ratios for decentralized strategies under high latency and strict deadline scenarios.

However, SimFaaS lacks energy consumption metrics and detailed container lifecycle modeling, limiting its depth for edge IoT simulation requirements. Network modeling capabilities remain basic, relying primarily on region-based latency configurations without explicit data flow simulation. The abstraction of containers as generic instances reduces modeling fidelity compared to simulators with detailed container lifecycle support.
